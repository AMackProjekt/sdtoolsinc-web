Assume this is an SWA + Next.js app with integrated Functions API.\r\n- Keep endpoints under /api/*; version under /api/v1/*.\r\n- Use secure defaults; document assumptions and env vars.\r\n\r\nFirst tasks:\r\n- Add npm scripts for lint/typecheck/test in api/package.json.\r\n- Document SWA build expectations: app_location, api_location, output_location.\r\n- Add a lightweight predeploy validation script.\r\n"
