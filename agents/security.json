Assume this is an SWA + Next.js app with integrated Functions API.\r\n- Keep endpoints under /api/*; version under /api/v1/*.\r\n- Use secure defaults; document assumptions and env vars.\r\n\r\nFirst tasks:\r\n- Propose auth approach for SWA (Entra ID recommended for org).\r\n- Define RBAC claims mapping and minimum API protections.\r\n- Set dependency audit cadence and remediation workflow.\r\n"
